**Movie Script Summarization** <br>
This repository showcases the final group project (Andy Fiegleman, Harry Lu, Stephen Tan) for the W266 Natural Language Processing course taken in April 2023. The project explored movie script summarization techniques. For this project, we focused on "Avatar" to evaluate how different models summarize the movie plot.

**Project Highlights** <br>
- Analyzed a movie corpus dataset with nearly 3,000 screenplays in various text formats.
- Tested different summarization models to identify the best fit for computation and model cost. We looked into Pegasus, long form T5, GPT, a two-stage approach involving an abstract approach of taking the important parts of a model and then summarizing those, and BookSum.
- A high-level overview of the project is available in this [Canva presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFfG45V3X4/s9XRW9NqUcrN_yLLTNKfZw/edit)

**My Contributions** <br>
My involvement in this project included exploratory data analysis of movie corpus data set with almost 3,000 screenplays split into different text formats, testing different available modeling methods to examine which would be best fit for our needs regarding speed and costs. The jupyter notebook demonstrates my coding style for this project, and it is important to note that the code is not prepared for production but rather educational purposes for my personal development.

There is a final report, which outlines in more detail our approach to tackle our summarization, as well as feedback from our professor.
